For my three SOLID principles, I chose Single Responsibility Principle, Open/Closed Principle, and Liskov Substitution Principle

Single Responsibility Principle
SRP Violated: A user class that lets you store a user's name, save a user to a database, and send a user an email.
SRP Solved: Seperating those three functions into their own classes, so that each class only has a single Responsibility.

Open/Closed Principle
OCP Violated: 
OCP Solved: 

Liskov Substitution Principle
